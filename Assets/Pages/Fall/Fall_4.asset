  PageText: So she ran as hard as she could, trying to keep up with her friends.
    Robin flew swiftly through the air. Squirrel lept from branch to branch with
    grace. Mouse scurried through the leaves. Ermine chased after them. The howling
    was catching up. The wind grasped at Ermine's heels. She tripped, and tumbled,
    and stumbled, and fell, as her friends bounded off.
