  PageText: The day was bright and full of color. A pleasant breeze rustled the leaves
    as Ermine played with her friends. She and her friends - Robin, Mouse, and Squirrel
    - lept through the crunchy leaves of autumn, enjoying the vibrant hues and glittery
    sunshine. Life was warm and good.
