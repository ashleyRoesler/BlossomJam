  - '"Here, follow me," Fox said, and led everyone to a small pile of leaves behind
    his burrow. He carefully moved the leaves away and revealed some brilliantly
    pink flowers. Ermine gasped at how colorful they were.'
  - '"During Winter''s last visit, I stumbled upon a single flower that had somehow
    grown despite the snow and the freezing cold. It showed me that Winter was weakening,
    and that spring would soon be here again. I took the flower and showed Winter,
    and he was so afraid that he ran off!"'
  - '"Ever since then, I''ve made sure to keep a few flowers growing just in case,
    and knowing that they are there helps me stay warm." Fox took one of the flowers
    and gave it to Ermine. "I believe that you could do the same thing."'
