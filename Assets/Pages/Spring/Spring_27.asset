  PageText: "So the group followed Owl as she flew through the trees until they reached
    a small hole.\n\t\"Fox? Are you there?\" Owl called out into the hole. A moment
    later, after some rustling, a white fox popped its head out. The group was startled.
    If Fox had defeated Winter, then why was his color gone?\n\t\"Oh! Hello! What
    can I do for you?\" Fox smiled cheerfully, despite his snowy appearance.\n\t\"Is
    it true that you've defeated Winter?\" Ermine asked, skeptical.\n\t\"It is indeed!
    Though,\" he said as he fully emerged to greet the group, \"it may not look like
    it. Every time Winter comes around, I still seem to lose all my color. But I'm
    still warm on the inside, which is the important part.\" Ermine was mystified.\n\t\"How
    did you do it? Can I be warm again, too?\""
