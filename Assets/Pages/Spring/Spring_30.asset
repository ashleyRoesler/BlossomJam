  - '"So... weak. You think that will stop me again?" Winter jeered.'
  - A terrible claw reached out from the nothingness. Ermine and her friends jumped
    back. The claw stole away the flower, Ermine's last hope, her warmth, her future,
    her color, and crushed it. Its pieces drifted away into the dark.
  - '"HAH! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" The world was spinning. Ermine''s breath was short. Was
    it all over? What was there left to do? Her proof of spring was gone. She couldn''t
    breathe.'
