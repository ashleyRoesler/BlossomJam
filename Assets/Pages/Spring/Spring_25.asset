  PageText: "\"Is W- is Winter here, too?\" Ermine asked, not sure if she wanted
    to hear the answer. Robin nodded solemnly.\n\t\"Unfortunately.\"\n\t\"Is there
    no way to stop him? To get rid of him? Are we forced to live under his rule forever
    now?\" Ermine fought off creeping despair.\n\t\"Hmm,\" pondered Robin. \"I wonder...
    You know, this isn't the first time Winter has shown up. I've heard from others
    that someone chased him off somehow. Maybe if we find them, they can help us
    do the same again!\" The group all nodded with determination.\n\t\"Do you know
    who it was?\" Squirrel asked.\n\t\"Er, no....\"\n\t\"Ah, but I do,\" a new voice
    said."
