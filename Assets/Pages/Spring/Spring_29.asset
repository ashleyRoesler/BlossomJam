  PageText: "Ermine gingerly took the flower, filled with newfound courage. Her friends
    gathered around her.\n\t\"We'll be with you the whole time,\" Mouse assured.\n\t\"Yeah,
    we won't let him get you! Never in a million years!\" Squirrel gave Ermine a
    hug.\n\t\"We believe in you.\" Ermine gave Robin a determined nod. Suddenly,
    in the distance, came the warning chorus of crows, signaling Winter's arrival.
    Ermine took a deep breath."
