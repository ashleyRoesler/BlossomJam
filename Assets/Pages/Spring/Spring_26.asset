  PageText: "\"Owl!\" Everyone turned toward the voice and found Owl, sitting just
    above them. She smiled at them.\n\t\"You'll need to find Fox. Last Winter, they
    found themselves in a predicament much like Ermine's. They lost all of their
    color and were nearly taken.\"\n\t\"How did they defeat Winter?\" Ermine asked.\n\t\"Of
    that, I am not sure. But I know where they live, and I can take you to them.\""
