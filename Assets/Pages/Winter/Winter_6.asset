  PageText: It was very cold as Ermine wandered through this unfamiliar stretch of
    the woods. She looked for anything familiar that would lead her back home and
    back to her friends, but there was nothing. Even the normal voices of the forest,
    birdsong and the chatter of other creatures, were strangely missing. The only
    sound was the bitter wind.
