  PageText: "\"Oh! Er, I didn't mean to wake you! I just needed to find a place to
    hide! Sorry!\" ermine stammered, hoping the bear wouldn't decide to eat her.
    The bear yawned and lifted its head to see Ermine fully.\n\t\"First Winter?\"
    Bear asked sleepily, knowingly. Ermine nodded. \"It's pretty rough out there,
    huh. You're welcome to stay as long as you like.\" And with that, Bear rolled
    back over and the soft snoring soon resumed."
