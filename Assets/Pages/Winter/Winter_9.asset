  - Ermine didn't know how far she'd gone. Winter's laugh still rang through her
    ears. Or was he still there? All around her, covering the forest, coating every
    leaf, bubbling up under her feet, filling her mind. The trees loomed over her.
  - She needed to hide. She looked around and spotted a dark cave, barely visible.
    Surely Winter could not find her there! So she ran with the last of her strength
    into the safety of the dark.
