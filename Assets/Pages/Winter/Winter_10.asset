  - Ermine sat for a while to catch her breath, enjoying the darkness and quiet.
    Except, as the ringing in her ears faded, she noticed that it was not quiet at
    all. The dark was... snoring?
  - Ermine hesitantly searched for the source of the sound and accidentally ran into
    something soft, warm, and very, very large. She leapt back in surprise. It was
    a bear! The bear rolled over and opened one eye to peek at the intruder.
