  - Ermine ran toward where she'd heard the voice of her friends. She stopped and
    strained her ears, trying to hear them again. The wind was picking up, and the
    snow was making it hard to see.
  - She though she heard the echo of her name again. Or had it just been the wind?
    Or was it the crows? Where had they come from? They blanketed the trees, darkening
    the already blurry sky.
  - Worried, Ermine turned back to the cave, but it was gone. Why was it so foggy
    all of a sudden?
  - A creeping feeling crawled through Ermine, and she knew. She knew this chilly
    breath, this haunting force. Winter had found her again.
