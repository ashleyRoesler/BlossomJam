  PageText: "\"Hey,\" a hollow voice said. Ermine spun around and found a pure-white
    hare staring at her.\n\t\"Uh... H-hello?\"\n\t\"Just give up.\"\n\t\"What? What
    do you mean?\"\n\t\"Just give up. Winter's rule is inevitable. Just let him take
    you.\" Hare's stare was unwavering, intense, yet completely empty of any emotion.
    He had no color, no life, no warmth. He was barely existing. Is this what would
    happen to her?"
