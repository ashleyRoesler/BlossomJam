  PageText: Ermine ran toward where she'd heard the voice of her friends. She stopped
    and strained her ears, trying to hear them again. The wind was picking up, and
    the snow was making it hard to see. She though she heard the echo of her name
    again. Or had it just been the wind? Or was it the crows? Where had they come
    from? They blanketed the trees, darkening the already blurry sky. Worried, Ermine
    turned back to the cave, but it was gone. Why was it so foggy all of a sudden?
