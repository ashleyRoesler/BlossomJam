  - "\"Hey,\" a hollow voice said. Ermine spun around and found a pure-white hare
    staring at her.\n\t\"Uh... H-hello?\"\n\t\"Just give up.\""
  - "\"What? What do you mean?\"\n\t\"Just give up. Winter's rule is inevitable.
    Just let him take you.\""
  - Hare's stare was unwavering, intense, yet completely empty of any emotion. He
    had no color, no life, no warmth. He was barely existing. Is this what would
    happen to her?
