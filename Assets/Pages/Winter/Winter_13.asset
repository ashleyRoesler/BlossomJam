  PageText: Relieved, Ermine curled up and watched as snow started softly falling
    outside the cave. Winter didn't seem too bad from inside the cave. The snow was
    almost pretty, even. Maybe she should just stay in the cave and sleep until Winter
    passed, as Bear seemed to be doing. Except, Ermine wondered, how long would Winter's
    reign last? How long could she last in this cave? Would Winter ever leave? Would
    she have to stay here forever? She rested and pondered and watched as the snow
    grew heavier and heavier.
