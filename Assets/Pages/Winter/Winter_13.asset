  - A faint sound made its way into the cave. Ermine sat up and pricked up her ears.
    It sounded familiar. She listened closer.
  - '"Ermine!" She jumped up. It was faint but she was sure. It was her friends!
    They had found her!'
  - She looked at Bear who peacefully slumbered. "Thank you," she whispered, and
    ran out of the cave to find her friends and finally go home.
